# Pomodoro Timer
This is a simple implementation of a Pomodoro timer, a time management technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The user can add tasks to a list, and start a timer for each task by clicking on the "Start" button. The timer counts down from 25 minutes, and when it reaches zero, it automatically switches to a 5-minute break timer. When the break timer reaches zero, the user can start another task.

The JavaScript code uses object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to define classes for tasks and lists of tasks. It also uses DOM manipulation to render the list of tasks on the page and handle user input, such as adding new tasks and starting timers. The code also implements setInterval() to update the timer every second, and clearInterval() to stop the timer and break timers when they reach zero.

Overall, this Pomodoro timer can help users manage their time more efficiently and stay focused on their tasks by providing a structured schedule and regular breaks.
